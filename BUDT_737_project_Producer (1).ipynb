        "The skill_map is used only during preprocessing to extract a structured list of skills from unstructured job descriptions, since the LinkedIn API does not always return explicit skill fields. It helps populate a consistent skills_required column for each job. However, the actual recommendation logic is based on sentence embeddings and cosine similarity — not on this mapping. So skill_map is just a lightweight feature engineering step, not a rule-based recommender."
